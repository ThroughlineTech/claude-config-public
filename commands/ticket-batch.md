# Batch a Set of Tickets

Run investigate → auto-approve → implement → preview on multiple tickets in parallel, each in its own git worktree. Prowl the user once when the whole batch is ready. This is the workflow for queuing up work and coming back later to smoke-test everything at once.

> **Prefer `/ticket-chain`** for most use cases. Chain mode does everything batch does (parallel investigation, parallel implementation in worktrees) but also detects dependencies, computes execution waves, deploys to preview/staging, and generates a consolidated review checklist. Use `/ticket-batch` when you specifically want rollup/individual preview infrastructure with port management, or when the project needs the batch-specific preview modes.

## Input

Arguments: a list of ticket IDs, OR no arguments.

- `/ticket-batch TKT-014 TKT-015 TKT-016` — operate on exactly these tickets
- `/ticket-batch 14 15 16` — same thing (bare numbers are expanded; see ID shorthand below)
- `/ticket-batch` — operate on **every** ticket in the active set whose status is `open` (i.e. "do all queued work")

**ID shorthand:** Any argument that is a bare number (e.g., `14` or `3`) is resolved to a full ticket ID: read the ticket prefix from `.claude/ticket-config.md`, scan existing ticket files to determine the zero-padding width, and expand (e.g., `14` → `TKT-014`). Full IDs and bare numbers can be mixed freely.

Optional flags:
- `--mode=auto|rollup|individual` — override the project's `Preview mode`. Default: whatever `.claude/ticket-config.md` says.
- `--no-preview` — implement everything but skip the preview step (you just want the branches built).
- `--sequential` — force one-at-a-time execution even on projects where parallel is fine.

## Pre-flight Checks

- `.claude/ticket-config.md` must exist. If not, tell the user to run `/ticket-install` and stop.
- Read Test, Build, and Preview commands + Preview mode + Preview port base from the config.
- Working tree must be clean. If dirty, STOP — batch mode creates worktrees which requires a clean base.
- Determine the main branch.

## Phase 0: Auto-reap stale worktrees

Before anything else, run the `/ticket-cleanup` reaper logic inline: walk `.worktrees/ticket-*/`, resolve each to a ticket ID, and remove the worktree + kill any preview PID for any ticket whose file lives in a terminal subfolder or doesn't exist. This is the ambient self-healing — it means previous crashed batches don't accumulate.

## Phase 1: Resolve the ticket set

1. If IDs were given, **locate each ticket file**. Each must be in the active set (not in `shipped/`, `deferred/`, `wontfix/`). Any terminal ticket → STOP and report.
2. If no IDs given, list all files at `{tickets-dir}/{PREFIX}*.md` (root only, not recursive) with status `open` from the frontmatter.
3. For each ticket, verify status is one of: `open` (most common — we'll investigate then implement) or `proposed` (investigation already done — we'll skip straight to implement).
4. Reject `in-progress`, `review`, `delegated`, or any terminal status — these are mid-flight and should not be batched.

If the resolved set is empty, STOP with "no tickets to batch."

## Phase 2: Pre-implement conflict check (static)

For each ticket in the set, read its `Implementation Plan` section and extract any file paths it mentions (grep for file-like tokens, backtick-quoted paths, etc.). This is best-effort — the plan's format isn't rigid. Intersect the sets pairwise.

If any pair of tickets lists overlapping files, print a warning but **do not block**:

```
⚠ Pre-implement conflict check:
    TKT-014 and TKT-015 both plan to touch src/auth.ts
    TKT-015 and TKT-017 both plan to touch src/session.ts
  Proceeding anyway. Post-implement diff check will confirm what actually happened.
```

Tickets with status `open` don't have an Implementation Plan yet — skip them in this check (the plan will exist after investigation).

## Phase 3: Create worktrees

For each ticket in the set:

1. Determine the branch name: `ticket/{lowercased-id}-{slugified-title}` (same scheme `/ticket-approve` uses).
2. If the ticket already has a `branch` field and that branch exists, reuse it. Otherwise create it from `{main}`.
3. Create the worktree: `git worktree add .worktrees/ticket-{lowercased-id} {branch}` (or `-b {branch} {main}` if the branch doesn't exist yet).
4. Update the ticket's `branch` field if it was empty.

`.worktrees/` should be in `.gitignore` — add it if it isn't.

## Phase 4: Investigate + implement (parallel subagents)

Spawn one subagent per ticket using the Agent tool, **in parallel** (a single message with multiple Agent tool calls), unless `--sequential` was passed.

Each subagent gets a prompt roughly like:

> You are working on ticket {ID} in an isolated git worktree at `.worktrees/ticket-{lowercased-id}/`. Your job: bring the ticket from its current status to `review`.
>
> 1. If status is `open`: run the equivalent of `/ticket-investigate {ID}` — read the ticket, explore the codebase, fill in Investigation, Proposed Solution, Implementation Plan in the ticket file. Then auto-transition to `proposed` and continue.
> 2. If the ticket's `## Investigation` section records `Regression Risk: high`, STOP and leave status at `proposed`. Do NOT implement. Report "high regression risk — needs human approval."
> 3. If status is `proposed` (including just-transitioned): run the equivalent of `/ticket-approve {ID}` **without creating a new branch** — the worktree is already on the right branch. Implement the plan, write tests, run `{Test}` and `{Build}` from ticket-config, fill in Files Changed + Test Report sections, commit each logical unit with `{ID}: ...` messages.
> 4. On successful build + tests, transition status to `review`. Report back: branch, commit count, files changed, test count, build status.
> 5. On failure (tests fail, build fails, plan is impossible, etc.): leave the ticket in whatever state makes sense (`proposed` if investigation found the plan unworkable, `in-progress` if implementation partially happened), and report the failure. Do NOT ship broken code.
>
> All work happens in the worktree. Do NOT touch the main repo directory.

Collect each subagent's result. Track:
- Which tickets succeeded to `review`
- Which tickets stopped at `proposed` (high regression risk — manual gate)
- Which tickets failed outright (with reason)

### Copy updated ticket files back to the main working directory

Subagents write to worktree copies of the ticket files, but the user views and edits tickets from the main branch. After all subagents complete, sync the results back:

1. For each ticket that reached `proposed` or `review` status, copy `.worktrees/ticket-{lowercased-id}/tickets/{ID}.md` over `tickets/{ID}.md` in the main working directory.
2. Stage the updated ticket files: `git add tickets/{ID}.md` for each.
3. Commit: `ticket-batch: update {N} tickets with investigation results` (where N is the number of files copied).

If no tickets were updated (all failed), skip this step.

## Phase 5: Post-implement conflict check (dynamic)

For each ticket that successfully reached `review`, run `git diff {main}...{branch} --name-only` and collect the file lists. Intersect them pairwise.

Build a `conflict_notes` dictionary: for each ticket, a list of "also touched by TKT-XXX" strings. This gets attached to the preview output so you know which combinations to inspect carefully.

## Phase 6: Preview

**Mode selection:**
- `--mode` flag if given, else `Preview mode` from config, else `individual`.
- If the `## Preview profiles` section is empty or `--no-preview` was passed, skip this entire phase.
- If **any** component of **any** profile used by tickets in this batch has `Sequential: true` (e.g. iOS simulator), force `individual` mode — rollup makes no sense when previews can't coexist.

**Group tickets by profile.** Each `review`-status ticket has an `app:` field identifying its profile. Group the batch by profile, because:
- Rollup only makes sense *within* a profile (you can't merge server-only tickets with iOS-only tickets into one preview).
- Sequential profiles have to be handled differently from parallel ones.

For each profile group, decide mode independently: a batch with 3 server tickets and 2 iOS tickets will run the server group in rollup/parallel mode and the iOS group sequentially.

### Mode: `individual`

For each `review`-status ticket in the batch, launch a preview exactly as `/ticket-preview {ID}` would:
- Port = `{Preview port base} + {numeric-id}`
- Worktree at `.worktrees/ticket-{lowercased-id}/`
- Record PID + meta in `.worktrees/ticket-{lowercased-id}/.preview.pid` and `.preview.meta`
- If `Preview sequential: true`, launch them one at a time, waiting for user confirmation between each (AskUserQuestion: "done with TKT-014 preview? ready for TKT-015?").

### Mode: `rollup`

1. Create a scratch branch from `{main}`: `git checkout {main} && git checkout -b batch-preview-{YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM}`.
2. Merge each successful ticket branch into the scratch branch in ID order: `git merge ticket/{...} --no-ff -m "batch-preview: include {ID}"`.
3. If any merge hits a conflict:
   - **`rollup` mode (forced):** abort the merge, reset the scratch branch, delete it, FAIL the batch preview with a clear report of which ticket conflicted with which. Do not fall back.
   - **`auto` mode:** abort, reset, delete the scratch branch, and fall through to `individual` mode. Include a note in the final output: "rollup failed at TKT-XXX (conflicts with TKT-YYY); fell back to individual previews."
4. On successful rollup: launch the `Preview command` once on the scratch branch. Port = `{Preview port base} + 999` (reserved for rollups). Record PID + meta in `.worktrees/batch-preview-{timestamp}/.preview.pid`.

### Mode: `auto`

Try `rollup` first. On any merge conflict, fall back to `individual` as described above.

## Phase 7: Final prowl + report

**One** prowl at the end of the batch — never per-ticket.

- Application: `Claude Code: ticket-batch`
- Event: `Batch ready — {N} tickets`
- Description: a compact summary of what's previewable and where (URLs, ports, simulator notes). Include counts: `{n} ready for review, {m} high-risk paused at proposed, {k} failed`.
- Priority: `1` (high) if there are any failures, `0` otherwise.

Terminal output:

```
BATCH COMPLETE

Requested:  {N} tickets
Ready:      {n} → status review
Paused:     {m} → status proposed (high regression risk, needs manual approval)
Failed:     {k} → see details below

Preview mode: {auto→rollup | auto→individual (fell back) | rollup | individual | skipped}

{if rollup:}
Rollup preview: http://localhost:3999   (combined branch: batch-preview-{timestamp})
Includes: TKT-014, TKT-015, TKT-016

{if individual:}
Previews:
  TKT-014  http://localhost:3014   (also touches src/auth.ts with TKT-015)
  TKT-015  http://localhost:3015   (also touches src/auth.ts with TKT-014)
  TKT-016  http://localhost:3016

Conflict notes:
  TKT-014 ↔ TKT-015: both modified src/auth.ts
    → they may conflict at ship time; ship order matters, or defer one

Paused (high risk):
  TKT-020  regression risk: high — manual approval needed
    Run /ticket-approve TKT-020 after reviewing the investigation

Failed:
  TKT-022  tests failed after implementation: 3 regressions in auth_test.ts
    Worktree left at .worktrees/ticket-tkt-022 for inspection

Next:
  Ship the good ones:   /ticket-ship TKT-014
  Defer regressions:    /ticket-defer {ID} {reason}   (also auto-rebuilds rollup)
  Stop a preview:       /ticket-cleanup {ID}
  Stop everything:      /ticket-cleanup --all
```

## Rules

- **Parallelism via subagents, not serialism.** Spawn all implementation agents in a single message with multiple Agent tool calls. The main thread only orchestrates. This keeps the main context small and lets real parallelism happen on build/test I/O.
- **High regression risk is a hard manual gate.** If an investigation writes `Regression Risk: high`, the batch must NOT auto-implement that ticket. It pauses at `proposed` and the final report calls it out.
- **Conflict checks never block.** They annotate. You decide.
- **One prowl.** Never per-ticket.
- **Never ship from batch mode.** Batch ends at preview. Shipping remains an explicit per-ticket decision (`/ticket-ship`).
- **Worktree cleanup happens on terminal transitions, not on batch end.** When you later run `/ticket-ship TKT-014`, that command tears down the TKT-014 worktree and preview as a side effect. Same for `/ticket-defer` and `/ticket-close`. So the batch leaves worktrees + previews live; they get reaped as you decide each ticket's fate.
- **If `/ticket-defer` or `/ticket-close` runs while a rollup preview is live**, that command must also rebuild the rollup (merge the remaining successful tickets into a new scratch branch, relaunch the preview). This is the "dynamic rollup" behavior.
- **Failures leave the worktree intact** for post-mortem. The next `/ticket-cleanup` or subsequent batch's auto-reap will clean them up once the ticket transitions to a terminal state (or you manually `/ticket-cleanup {ID}`).
